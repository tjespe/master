%\textit{Briefly touch upon the need for better uncertainty estimates in finance and how probabilistic AI models have started to fill gaps left by traditional econometric approaches.}
In recent years, there has been a significant increase in the use of artificial intelligence (AI)\footnote{See Table \ref{table:abbreviations} for a list of all abbreviations used in this paper.
} and machine learning (ML) models within finance, motivated by AI models' potential to provide price forecasts despite an efficient market \parencite{sezer2020financial}. However, a major drawback of AI models is that they are to a large extent ``black boxes'' making it difficult to understand how to interpret predictions and buy/sell recommendations. Probabilistic AI models partly alleviates this issue, as they can provide well-calibrated probabilities for different scenarios, allowing for more informed decision-making and sophisticated investment strategies. However, as this review will show, the usefulness of these probability estimates vary widely based on implementation.

Despite the increasing interest in AI, financial time series modeling is still dominated by econometric models \textcolor{red}{[SOURCE]}. Notable examples include ARIMA-family models for predicting future values (i.e., conditional mean) and GARCH models for modeling volatility (i.e., conditional variance). The Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) posits that the conditional mean cannot be predicted, as all information is already incorporated into the price, and econometric models that attempt this thus has very limited predictive power, if any \parencite{Campbell2007}. However, the EMH does not preclude the possibility of predicting the conditional variance, which is essential for risk management and portfolio optimization. GARCH models are widely used for this purpose. Nevertheless, econometric models such as ARIMA and GARCH remain constrained by their simple structure, and thus cannot capture the complex patterns often present in financial data \parencite{sezer2020financial}. In contrast, AI models have shown promise in capturing these complexities but have primarily been used to provide point forecasts (i.e., conditional mean) rather than full conditional probability distributions \parencite{Tang2022Survey}. This limits both the interpretability and the practical usefulness of their predictions. This survey examines whether applying probabilistic AI models' capabilities for more complex modeling to enhance uncertainty estimates could be valuable for improving decision-making, optimizing portfolios, and identifying arbitrage opportunities in derivative pricing, among other applications.

% Context
\textbf{Context}\nopagebreak

Probabilistic AI often refers to a Bayesian approach to machine learning, where probabilistic theory is used to infer plausible models to explain observed data \parencite{Ghahramani2015}. However, to capture all the research relevant for improving uncertainty estimates in finance, we extend the definition to include any ML/AI models that can quantify the uncertainty in their predictions or produce full distributional forecasts. These models have the potential to provide better understanding of potential future states and risk.

Probabilistic AI is a rapidly evolving area, as this review will demonstrate, and includes models like Bayesian neural networks, transformers, Variational Auto-Encoders, Gaussian processes and Hidden Markov models, among others. The number of articles within the field has risen sharply the last years, with many promising results in many cases. However, the majority of AI applications in finance have focused on generating precise point forecasts for prices or returns, and the potential usefulness of probabilistic predictions has received less attention \parencite{sezer2020financial}.

When discussing quantification of prediction uncertainty, it is important to distinguish between epistemic (model-driven) and aleatoric (underlying) uncertainty. Epistemic uncertainty arises from the model's limitations in capturing data patterns, reducible through better models or more data. Aleatoric uncertainty refers to inherent data randomness, equivalent to underlying volatility in finance. It is influenced by unpredictable market behavior, economic events, and investor sentiment, beyond the reach of any model \parencite[7,34]{pml1Book, KIUREGHIAN2009105, hullermeier2021aleatoric}. A sophisticated probabilistic AI model can quantify both types of uncertainty, as well as model how the epistemic uncertainty and the aleatoric uncertainty (volatility) changes over time. However, as this review will show, only a minority of proposed models fully exploit this possibility.


% Overview of research area

\textbf{Overview of Research Area}\nopagebreak

There have been several studies and reviews over the last years on the application of AI and machine learning for financial time series prediction. \textcite{gandhmalstockmarket2019}, \textcite{Li2020} and \textcite{Kumbure2022} all review machine learning techniques for stock market trend or point predictions. The studies review literature up to 2018, 2019 and 2019 respectively. \textcite{gandhmalstockmarket2019} conclude that ANN models and fuzzy-based techniques are the most promising among the reviewed machine learning approaches for accurate stock market predictions, further backed by \textcite{shi2019soft} review and implementation of soft computing approaches for stock market forecasting, also finding ANN architectures to consistently outperform other machine learning models in point prediction accuracy. \textcite{Li2020} show that LSTM implementations are most popular among the researchers utilizing deep learning methods. \textcite{Kumbure2022} conclude that most frequently utilized models where ANNs and SVMs, but conclude that deep learning models like LSTM have growing interest due to several reports of robust and improved predictions. 

A newer study was conducted by \textcite{Khattak2023SurveyAIModels}, providing an in-depth review of machine learning methods used to forecast various financial assets between 2018 and 2023. The study finds new hybrid integrations of LTSM and SVM architectures to be the most effective in financial market predictions, outperforming traditional models in point accuracy.

While there is a growing body of literature on AI and machine learning for financial applications, the aforementioned reviews focus solely on point prediction accuracy. Even though both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty are essential components of financial decision making, fewer reviews have been conducted on the topic of uncertainty quantification in a financial context using machine learning methods or probabilistic models specifically. \textcite{abdar2021ReviewUQ} conduct a thorough review on uncertainty quantification in deep learning techniques, discussing the advantages and disadvantages of several models, but do not focus on financial time series predictions. The authors conclude that Deep Ensembles and Bayesian Neural Networks show promising capabilities for uncertainty quantification distinguishing between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, possibly applicable to financial forecasting, but find that lack of standardized benchmarks make it difficult to compare frameworks.

\textcite{Blasco_et_al_2024} conduct a survey on uncertainty quantification using deep learning techniques in financial time series. The study shows that most articles do not distinguish between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and few authors perform analysis on the financial implications of predictive uncertainty. However, they limit their focus to deep learning techniques and do not assess the entire probabilistic AI field. Their focus on how to use and interpret the predictions in a financial context is also limited. The survey includes literature on deep learning up to 2022, but as we show in this review, production has seen an explosive increase over the last two years. 

In light of the rapid increase in published articles on probabilistic AI over recent years and the scarcity of reviews focused on uncertainty quantification for various financial time series, this review aims to address these gaps by synthesizing the current state-of-the-art research. Additionally, prior financial studies have predominantly concentrated on stock markets; in response, this review includes a range of asset classes, examining how uncertainty quantification varies across categories. Given that the defining feature of probabilistic AI models is their capacity to provide predictions with associated uncertainties, this review places substantial emphasis on interpreting these uncertainty estimates within a financial context. Finally, existing research reveals a lack of consensus regarding the evaluation of uncertainty estimates produced by probabilistic models. Accordingly, we summarize current evaluation practices and, based on this, propose a clear framework for future work.

To gain an understanding of the existing research, address the gaps identified in the literature, and advance the understanding of the use of probabilistic AI for uncertainty estimates in financial time series, this review seeks to answer the following key research questions: 
\begin{enumerate}[label=RQ\arabic*:]
    \item Summarize to what extent and in what way existing research are using uncertainty estimates from probabilistic AI models as measures of volatility, model uncertainty, or financial risk.
    \item Analyze researchers' motivation for making predictions with uncertainty and how it differs for different asset classes.
    \item Compare how promising probabilistic models' capabilities are compared to other machine learning models and traditional econometric models in uncertainty estimation.
    \item Investigate probabilistic models' ability to provide improved understanding of risk and volatility compared to econometric models.
    \item Identify the metrics used for assessing probabilistic AI models and assess what the most appropriate metrics for assessing the quality of the produced uncertainty estimates are.
    \item Analyze how probabilistic AI models can be used to construct financial risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES).
    \item Identity possible areas for further research.
\end{enumerate}

We will answer the questions directly in Section \ref{sec:discussion}, but they will shape the research and literature search and the presented results in Section \ref{sec:result_and_discussion}.

This review contributes to the field by offering a comprehensive overview of recent advances and identifying key strengths and limitations of these models in practice.

Specifically, this work explores how probabilistic AI models can enhance uncertainty estimates, distinguishing between aleatoric (data-driven) and epistemic (model-driven) uncertainty, and assesses their relevance for financial decision-making. In doing so, the review sheds light on whether probabilistic AI offers a meaningful improvement over traditional econometric models (e.g., GARCH) in quantifying and interpreting risk and volatility.

Key contributions include:

\begin{enumerate}

    \item Benchmarking and Evaluation: The review identifies best practices and gaps in benchmarking probabilistic AI models against traditional approaches, highlighting the need for standardized evaluation frameworks for predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification.
    \item Identification of Most Widely Used Models: We catalogue the probabilistic machine learning models most widely used in finance, such as Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs), Gaussian Processes (GPs), and Probabilistic Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and evaluate their potential for further research and application.
    \item Practical Guidance for Researchers: The review emphasizes how adopting probabilistic AI models can advance financial analysis by incorporating both point predictions and full distributional forecasts, enabling improved risk assessment, portfolio optimization, and market simulation.
    \item Roadmap for Future Research: We highlight key areas for advancing uncertainty
quantification in finance, including:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Using non-parametric distributions from probabilistic AI models to improve risk measures
            \item Separating epistemic from aleatoric uncertainty when using AI models with uncertainty quantification
            \item Establishing a standardized testing and benchmarking framework to prove that new proposed models are significant improvements over existing traditional models, while also establishing a practice of making code available so that the field can advance by successively building upon and testing against previously proposed models
            \item More inter-disciplinary collaboration to ensure that proposed models appropriately incorporates financial knowledge and state-of-the-art AI techniques
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

Ultimately, this review aims to serve as a foundational resource and guide for researchers and practitioners looking to apply or extend probabilistic AI techniques within finance, bridging the gap between machine learning advancements and financial applications.
